    <td><p>After 20 years in the commercial printing  business I started my vacation rental business in 2005 with our fantastic  5500sf log cabin. The cabin is spacious with 4 acres of tall pines in the  Prescott National Forest. </p>
      <p>We built the Cave Creek Mansion home in 2006 and made  it a full time vacation rental in 2009. This home has everything imaginable and  is perfect for large groups or families with high end tastes. </p>
      <p>The Paradise  Valley home was purchased in 2011 and immediately remodeled and landscaped as  the perfect vacation rental for groups that want a great location with plenty  to enjoy on the property. </p>
      <p>Our homes are all unique and offer much more than  your typical vacation homes. I pride myself in being very responsive and make  every effort to personally answer your every call. This is our full time  business and I am always available if you have a question or a concern. You  will not be talking with a property manager but with the property  owner/manager.</p>
      <p> I look forward to talking with you.</p><p>Travel safe John Bigelow 602-499-9971 </p></td>
