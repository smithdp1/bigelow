                <p>Spring Training baseball under the warm Arizona sun has been a tradition for devoted fans since 1947, when just two teams, the Cleveland Indians and the New York Giants, came here to prepare for the rigors of the long regular season. Today, 15 teams train in the Phoenix metropolitan area in the greatest concentration of professional baseball facilities found anywhere in the United States. For visitors, the Cactus League couldn't be more convenient, with short drive times between ballparks and a full range of hotel, dining and shopping amenities. Truly, the Cactus League is the premier destination for baseball lovers. And this website has everything fans need to enjoy one game or several during the 2014 Spring Training season. </p>
